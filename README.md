## About Project
Navigating a new space is always intimidating. We cannot 'Google-Maps' our way through corridors and unlisted spaces. It becomes all the more difficult if you cannot understand the local language. Moreover, GPS fails to work in closed spaces.  
*NAKSHA* is an indoor navigation solution for navigating premises inside an organisation. With AR at its core, it aims to aid people to find their way around new places easier than ever.


**Tech stack**:
- Unity 3D
- C#
